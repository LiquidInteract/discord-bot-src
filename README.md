# How to make it

1) goto discord.com/developers
2) create a new bot
3) within that bot you just made, make an application
4) get the bot token and copy it
5) paste the bot token under the "const token = 'Your token goes here';" on line 4
6) now start the executable the Start_Bot.bat file and your bot will be up and running
7) go to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html and enter the client id for the application

Just remember to change the bot token
